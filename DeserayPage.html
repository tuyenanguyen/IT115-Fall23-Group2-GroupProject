    <h2> <strong> About Me:</strong></h2> 
 
<section> <p>  Hello Everyone! <br>
<br>
My name is <b>Deseray</b> but I prefer to be called Des or Desi, for short. <br> 
I am a bit rusty when it comes to coding but I am hoping to get back into the "<em>swing of things</em>". I am hoping to increase my skills set with this class while also refresh up my skills. </p>
    
<p>I am currently enrolled in IT 115 for the Fall 2023 quarter and this is my group project page. <br>I have some experience with HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc. from taking other IT classes at <b> North Seattle College</b> about 2 years ago. This is my first IT class coming back to campus after lifestyle changes.</p>

<p>In the future, my plan is to complete my degree in Application Development and continue with my IT education at a nearby university. </p> 
     
 <h2> <strong> Life Outside of School:</strong></h2> 
    
<b>During my free time, I like to do the following things <em>(if I have time):</em></b>
   <ul>
        <li>Hiking with my children and boyfriend.</li>
        <li>Taking pictures of nature for my Instagram followers.</li>
        <li>Watching anime shows with my oldest daughter.
        <li>Watching the same 4 Disney movies with my youngest daughter.</li>
        <li>Playing video games with my family.</li>
       <li>Bing watching movies and/or TV shows. <em> (Korean dramas are    my favorite!)</em></li>
        <li>Reading different genres of books.<em> (Currently obsessed with my Kindle)</em></li>
         <li>Listening to music and just vibing. </li>
     </ul> 
    
     <b> But my favorite thing to do is spend time with my daughters, <em>Lilly </em> & <em>Evelyn</em> and my boyfriend,<em> Andrew</em>.</b> </section>
